a) Encapsulation is a concept where a class binds multiple data / attributes and functions / behaviors / methods
    together, while at the same time hiding the inside attributes, only exposing the necessary interface
    (public methods), while keeping the data inside invisible to user / other programmers
    to maintain stability of the object's behavior.
    Usually this is achieved by using access modifier such as public, protected, private, and in Java also the default
    access modifier (no modifier).
b)  first benefit: maintains the stability of object's behavior by protecting it from unwanted access by client
                   (either user or other programmer who uses the object)
    second benefit: able to make attributes in the class read-only or write-only  or both depending on your needs
                    by giving the attributes getter and setter methods.
c) public void setName(String a)
d) private String name
e) inside Genus.java
f) advantage: by having Specimen as the sub-class of Species,
              all the methods that Species has won't have
              to be redefined inside Specimen, only overriding and adding
              new methods as necessary.
   disadvantage: the disadvantage of this will be that Specimen object might not be usable
                 if the Species object have not been initialized.
